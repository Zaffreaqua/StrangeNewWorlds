# StrangeNewWorlds
Development of Strange New Worlds, an extrastellar system for Kerbal Space Program.

This mod adds a triple star system based off of our own Polaris System, adding a system primarily of giant planets to the outer star. However, as you will see when you play it, I have taken some liberties and it is NOT a super realistic 1:1 recreation. It takes inspiration from the Mu Arae system, James Cameron's Avatar, and twists on our own system.
