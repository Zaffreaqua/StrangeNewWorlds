# Strange New Worlds
Strange New Worlds, an extrastellar system for Kerbal Space Program.

This mod adds a triple star system based off of our own Polaris System, adding a system primarily of giant planets to the outer star. However, as you will see when you play it, I have taken some liberties and it is NOT a super realistic 1:1 recreation. It is also somewhat analogous to the Mu Arae planetary system.

The system is positioned 90 degrees above the home/stock system and lies about 4.3 kerbal light years away, or 0.43 real-scale light years away.



## REQUIRED MODS

Kopernicus: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200143-181-1111-kopernicus-stable-branch-last-updated-march-14th-2021/



### OPTIONAL/RECOMMENDED MODS

If you want to take a route that's less of a hassle, try wormholes with KopEx!
Kopernicus Expansion Continued-er: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/195844-19-111-kopernicus-expansion-continued-er/

If you want to get there the old fashioned way, I recommend Blueshift, KSPIE, or Far Future Technologies with Cavlin's buffed ISP patch. Oh, and Better Timewarp for your convenience. :P

If you want a nice home that meshes well with this system, try Beyond Home. If you want to give the lone Polaris system some friends, you cannot go wrong with Extrasolar and Galaxies Unbound.

### COMPATIBILITY

Being a mod that adds a new system away from the home system, Strange New Worlds should be compatible with most system replacers and other system-adding mods. Is it compatible with OPM you ask? Install it and find out. ;)
