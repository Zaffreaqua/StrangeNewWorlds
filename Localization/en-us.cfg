		#LOC_SNW_Stars_PolarisA_displayName = Porthos^N
		#LOC_SNW_Stars_PolarisA_description = <color=#FF495C>WARNING -- EXTREME HEAT HAZARD!</color> The north star. The one who lies above. Porthos, sometimes called Polaris A, is a yellow supergiant that is slightly deformed like a giant piece of popcorn with its giant convection cells. If it were in our system, it would easily swallow Moho's orbit! It would be best to stay far away from it. Porthos harbors two other stars within its influence, one of them confirmed to have planets.


		#LOC_SNW_Stars_PolarisAb_displayName = Athos^N
		#LOC_SNW_Stars_PolarisAb_description = <color=#FF495C>WARNING -- EXTREME HEAT HAZARD!</color> Polaris Ab is a bright star, though nowhere near as bright as A.  Curiously, our telescopes are picking up something large around it. It appears to be a ring, but instead of dust, it is solid! Multiple seem to be around it. We don't know what exactly they are, but it demands attention!


		#LOC_SNW_Stars_PolarisB_displayName = Aramis^N
		#LOC_SNW_Stars_PolarisB_description = <color=#FF495C>WARNING -- EXTREME HEAT HAZARD!</color> Aramis is the third and most distant member of the Polaris system. It is a main sequence star just a hair brighter than Kerbol, and harbors several rather prospective planets. On first observation, Aramis was thought to be a young F-type star, until one day its physical properties changed instantaneously. The reason is not known why. It's suspected something greater than the kraken desired it so... It's certainly more hospitable for life.


		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Pandemonium_displayName = Pandemonium^N
		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Pandemonium_description = <color=#FF495C>WARNING -- EXTREME HEAT HAZARD!</color> Pandemonium is not a place meant for kerbalkind, or any kind. One shudders to imagine what inkerbal thoughts go through the minds of those who want to send people there. What dreams of chronic and sustained cruelty! Pandemonium orbits its parent star in a hair over a day, and is by far the largest planet ever observed! Its dark as asphalt, but it's so close to the star it still burns bright and is stretched into an egg shape! Pandemonium may not have much longer to live, as scientists predict it will eventually be torn apart by Aramis.

		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Aeneas_displayName = Aeneas^N
		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Aeneas_description = Aeneas is a brilliant green super-Kerbin, one not unlike Eve. Unlike Eve however, its atmosphere is much thinner and it appears to have had much greater oceans in its own past, which have become seas sunken within the former ocean floor. Its green coloration comes from oxidized copper and other minerals on the surface. We suspect this planet was much like Kerbin early in its history.

		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Usir_displayName = Usir^N
		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Usir_description = <color=#FFC013>Potentially habitable conditions detected.</color> Usir is the most massive planet orbiting Aramis. Its bands and storms are turbulent, and judging by its enormous rings, it's turbulent with its children too. It chewed one apart! We best hope it doesn't decide to chew apart any vehicles that come too close. Usir's rings can be spotted with the naked eye from Aeneas and Poseidon.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Maxmin_displayName = Maxmin^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Maxmin_description = This object is an iron Minmus; a small lumpy moon comprised almost entirely of iron.  It stands defiant among the dust of its former shell, refusing to kneel to Usir's crushing gravity.  Its place within Usir's large rings offers quite a view for the aspiring kerbal.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Flint_displayName = Flint^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Flint_description = Flint is a moon of 2 faces, one new, one old. Usir's tidal forces induce volcanic activity which materializes on the side facing its parent planet. Large volcanic calderas dot the moon's near side. The ancient far side meanwhile remains not much changed from its juvenile days. Curiously, the volcanism does not seem to be global.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Denali_displayName = Denali^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Denali_description = <color=#FFC013>Potentially habitable conditions detected.</color> This moon is only about the size of Mun, yet it has an atmosphere and even oceans peaking through its icy shell!  Geological activity produces an atmosphere and a layer of airborne dust, reflecting the light of Polaris away, where the moon would otherwise lose its water.  Holes and fissures appear in the icy surface due to currents and volcanic activity heating the subsurface ocean.  A small amount of oxygen has been detected in the atmosphere, but neither jets or helmet removal are options, for the oxygen levels are not high enough and dust poses too great of a problem.  Scientists suspect it may even have life.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Oceanus_displayName = Oceanus^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Oceanus_description = <color=#FFC013>Potentially habitable conditions detected.</color> A true water world, Oceanus has an ocean far, far deeper than anything in our home system. Large enough to hold some enormous krakens! Oceanus is thought to have been captured early on in its life by Usir and assimilated into Usir's system of moons, flinging stragglers and distant moons away.
			#LOC_SNW_Moons_Oceanus_BiomeName1 = Poles
			#LOC_SNW_Moons_Oceanus_BiomeName2 = Global Ocean

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Cassini_displayName = Cassini^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Cassini_description = Cassini is a submoon, or a moon orbiting a moon! Its shape is unusual, as normally it would topple over with its long axis facing its parent. Why doesn't it do this? Some say it's limitations, some say it's liberties taken in the creation process... Whatever could they mean? This submoon would make for a nice stop before attempting to explore Oceanus' depths.

			#LOC_SNW_Moons_Cassini_BiomeName3 = Craters




		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Poseidon_displayName = Poseidon^N
		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Poseidon_description = Poseidon is a precious blue orb of a gas giant, with water clouds and small amounts of oxygen in its atmosphere. It plays host to particularly violent storms. Most of its cyclones could swallow Kerbin whole! Despite this, it seems to be the calmest of its siblings, having not gone insane and on its side or went to tearing apart its own moons. Poseidon hosts several particularly unique major moons; all of them have an atmosphere and some sort of liquid on their surface! Poseidon's gravity continues to draw in minor objects from the asteroid belt beyond which crash into it and its moons, making for extra resilient life evolved to power through the disasters as well as rich mineral deposits.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Vetinghier_displayName = Vetinghier^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Vetinghier_description = <color=#FF3E00>CAUTION -- MOLTEN MATERIAL PRESENT!</color> Vetinghier was the last of the moons to be made out by astronomers.  A world extraordinarily rich in metals like iron, it has an intense gravitational pull for its size, allowing it to stand up to the power of Poseidon's vicinity. Molten rock has become exposed on its surface after cataclysmic collisions combined with the intense tides of its parent and sibling moons.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Arkhalo_displayName = Arkhalo^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Arkhalo_description = <color=#04D22D>BIOSIGNATURES DETECTED!</color> This water rich moon wears its rings like a necklace, unlike Poseidon which proudly wears its like a crown. Arkhalo is a unique place. Its vibrant and tenacious purple surface life gives it a unique color, unlike anything seen or predicted before. Those who are researching it suggest pictures and samples of this lush, vibrant moon will greatly impact Kerbalkind forever. But beware the radiation and occasional meteorite impact.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Hreveldor_displayName = Hreveldor^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Hreveldor_description = <color=#04D22D>BIOSIGNATURES DETECTED!</color> The largest and most massive of Poseidon's moons.  It is the most Kerbin-like object found in the system discovered so far. Were it not for the astonishing presence of life, this would probably make a great spot for a colony! It's slightly chillier than its inward sibling, giving rise to large white icecaps that nicely compliment its hues of red and blue.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Kisa_displayName = Kisa^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Kisa_description = <color=#FFC013>Potentially habitable conditions detected.</color> This one has not received the same blessing like its inner cousins.  It only received half of what it's siblings got, like a forgotten or despised child.  It sadly orbits outside of the rest of its family.  Yet maybe, just maybe, it could feel love again if we settled on it.  A more ideal target than the rest to be certain.  We'd rather not be scorched by lava or eaten alive by alien krakens.  <color=#FFD810>The distant orbit and peaceful nature of this moon makes it a target to consider when placing a colony.</color>

		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Gyro_displayName = Gyro^N
		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Gyro_description = Gyro is one of the strangest worlds observed. It's on its side, as are its moons! Its deep red hue is unique among gas giants, in stark contrast to its warmer, blue and white counterparts closer Aramis. It hosts a more modest set of moons, but they are worth a visit nonetheless!

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Boreal_displayName = Boreal^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Boreal_description = <color=#FFC013>Potentially habitable conditions detected.</color> A frigid world of water, Boreal is covered in scars and fissures from mineral-rich water forcing its way through the surface ice. Boreal is thought to have an enormous ocean below its icy crust, one that may host life! Curiously, it has a very thin atmosphere, possibly even a hint of a magnetosphere.

		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Kawah_displayName = Kawah^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Kawah_description = <color=#FF3E00>CAUTION -- MOLTEN MATERIAL PRESENT!</color> A world of lava and smelly rocks, Kawah is another victim of too much tidal heating. It is the smallest known world with such activity. Interestingly, the lava does not appear to be red or orange. It's blue! Gas rich in sulfur burns, giving it its unusual color.

		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Mephitis_displayName = Mephitis^N
		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Mephitis_description = It smells. Badly. Like, really badly. So badly in fact, that the kraken itself has written a letter to our management telling us that it refuses to do so much as go near it! We'll see kraken, we shall see.  Mephitis is much more massive than Jool, but is only a little larger than half its size due to its status as an ice giant. It hosts perhaps the most unusual set of companions in the Polaris system.


		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Anomal_displayName = Anomal^N
		#LOC_SNW_Moons_Anomal_description = <color=#FF00F4>ANOMALY DETECTED!</color> A fat and dirty pancake of a world, Anomal sits within the rings of its unusually dense and stinky parent. Marked with craters and with a speedy rotation, at first we thought it would be difficult to maintain a hold on this peculiar object's surface. However, our observations put Anomal at a disturbingly high mass and density. Far too much for an object of its size. This makes keeping a hold on the surface easier, but beware of what may be behind the cause of this... Anomaly.

		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Malodor_displayName = Malodor^N
		#LOC_SNW_Planets_Malodor_description = BLEH! This one is less massive but just as stinky! Malodor is a quarter of the mass of its companion, but does not differ much in size. As a matter of fact, it is even larger than the more massive Mephitis! Malodor does not face the gravitational compression that Mephitis does due to its lower mass.
